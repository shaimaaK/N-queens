# Solving N-queens problem using Genetic Algorithm
Evolutionary Approach is studied for solving the N-Queens problem using Genetic Algorithm, implemented as part of the Evolutionary Computation Course 
in my Masters degree in AI.
The project analyzes the N-Queens problem and defines the cost function, solution represntations as(Phenotype, Genotype) where the Genetic Algorithm is applied and experimented
with different chess board dimensions (N x N). My solution is finally visualized in matlab app where users have live run of the evolutionary algorithm after entering the 
parameters of their experiments then the results are directly visualized and easily analyzed in terms final fitness, final solution, solution convergence curve over generations.

 ## Abstract 
 The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing N number of queen pieces on the chessboard where no queen is placed in a location that allows it to attack the
 rest of queens placed on that same NxN chessboard. The N-Queens problem is famously solved is various ways namely recursion algorithms,, backtracking algorithms,
 constraint programming, logic programming, and using Evolutionary Algorithms. The difficulty of the problem is elevated by increasing the size of the chess board.
 This study is addressing the N-Queens problem using the state-of-art population-based Genetic Algorithm(GA)  utilizing its evolutionary operators such as 
 natural selection, crossover, and mutation. The implementation was proven to be successful and efficient through simulated experiments using matlab.
